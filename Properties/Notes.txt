You can prevent vscode from opening a new browser window everytime by removing the serverReadyAction section in the lainch.json file

Add this section for faster launching of program, by using run build task in Terminal menu or ctrl + shift + B
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }

Record Data Types - From .Net 5 and C# 9, This was introduced and although it is similar to classes, they ar eused for immutable objects, especially when you are receiving objects fromthe web and you are not expecting a change.
They also have the with-expressions support
They also allow for value based equality - where all the properties of the instance of an object are the smae to return true

{get; init;} is alson introduced when you onky want to be able to set the value of a property at initialisation
so you can only do this at creation but not the other after creation
// You can do this
Item item = new()
{
    Id = Guid.NewGuid()
};

// You cannot do this
Item.Id = Guid.NewGuid()

shortcut to launch property, tab completion prop tab tab

Repository - Class in charge of storig the object in the system

New addition in C# 9, Target types expressions
so instead of
List<Item> items = new List<Item>()
you can just do this
List<Item> items = new() {}
